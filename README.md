# Prism-Server

## Dependencies

Requires the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language binaries with the `GOPATH` environment variable specified.

## Installation

Typically a Go package installation is as simple as:

```bash
go get github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism-server
```

However, as this is hosted as a private repository, the following is required:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism-server && git pull
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
make deps
```

## Usage

This package provides a suite of HTTP and WebSocket handlers to connect the custom live tiling analytics of [prism](https://github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism/) to expressive REST and WebSocket endpoints. This package leverages the power of [goji](https://goji.io/), a minimalistic and feature rich web framework.

## Example

This minimalistic application shows how to register custom tile and meta data generators and connect them to a redis store.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"

    "github.com/zenazn/goji"

	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism/generation/elastic"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism/generation/meta"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism/generation/tile"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism/store"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism/store/redis"

	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism-server/conf"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism-server/routes/dispatch"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism-server/routes/meta"
	"github.com/unchartedsoftware/prism-server/routes/tile"
)

func main() {
	// Parse commandline flags into config struct
	config := conf.ParseCommandLine()
	// Register the in-memory store
	store.Register("redis", redis.NewConnection)
	// Register a custom tile and meta data generators
	tile.Register("heatmap", elastic.NewHeatmapTile)
	meta.Register("default", elastic.NewDefaultMeta)
    // Set the dispatching routes, these endpoints are used to initiate tiling
    // and meta data generation requests over websocket, providing full duplex
    // communication and allowing the server to inform the client the moment the
    // data is ready.
    goji.Get(dispatch.MetaRoute, dispatch.MetaHandler)
    goji.Get(dispatch.TileRoute, dispatch.TileHandler)
    // Set the tile request handler, once tile data is ready, this endpoint can
	// be used to get the generated tile data. If no data is ready this endpoint
    // will attempt to generate it.
    goji.Get(tile.Route, tile.Handler)
    // Set the metadata request handler, this will allow the client to request
	// metadata. If no data is ready this endpoint will attempt to generate it.
    goji.Get(meta.Route, meta.Handler)
	// Greedy route last for static serving
	goji.Get("/*", http.FileServer(http.Dir(config.Public)))
	// Start the server
	goji.Serve()
}
```

Start the server while providing commandline arguments.

```bash
go run main.go \
    -public="./public" \
	-alias="redis_local=localhost:6379" \
    -alias="elasticsearch_local=http://localhost:9200"
```

Generate meta data:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/default/elasticsearch_local/test_index/redis/redis_local'
```

This HTTP request results in the following actions:
- Generation of meta data using the 'default' generator on the `test_index` of an elasticsearch instance running on the endpoint aliased by `elasticsearch_local`.
- Caching of the generated data in a `redis` store running on the endpoint aliased by `redis_local`.

Generate a tile:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/heatmap/elasticsearch_local/test_index/redis/redis_local/4/12/12'
```

This HTTP request results in the following actions:
- Generation of a tile using the 'heatmap' generator on the `test_index` of an elasticsearch instance running on the endpoint aliased by `elasticsearch_local`.
- Caching of the generated tile in a `redis` store running on the endpoint aliased by `redis_local`.
